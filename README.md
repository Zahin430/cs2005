## Executable design
is defined as 
> a partial implementation of the system, built to demonstrate that the architectural design will be able to support 
the key functionality and, more importantly, to exhibit the right properties in terms of performance, throughput, 
capacity, reli- ability, scalability, and other “-ilities”

such as it should
> ideally be of sufficient quality to serve as the foundation of an evolutionary architecture

Hence, this branch contains the basic behind-the-scenes framework for our system. 
It implements the Profile class, the (run)Data class, a basic system for Challenges.
These are to be considered as the "base core functionality" of the system.

TL;DR: an architecture is:
- the structure of the system
- the most important components of the system
- the relationship between said components
- the reason a particular component was chosen, or the representation between aformentioned components
-  the design pattern used
