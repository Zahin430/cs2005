#### Description

This program was built using Java, and uses Maven to manage dependencies. 

After cloning, make sure to load the `pom.xlm` file, most IDEs recognize the file as having to do with Maven dependencies.

Run App.java, create your profile, and you're good to go! 


## Known issues:
 - it will look for images in the compiled code folder, and doesnt always copy them.
